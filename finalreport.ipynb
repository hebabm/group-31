    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**\n",
    "    Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, including the city of Cleveland in Ohio. Factors that affect the probability of contracting heart disease include, unhealthy diet, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, minimal physical activity, etc. (“Heart disease,” 2022). While heart disease symptoms depend on the type of heart disease, many common symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, and pain in the neck, jaw, and throat. As noted, chest pain is often associated with heart disease. Particularly angina is a chest pain caused by poor blood flow to the heart due to the buildup of thick plaques on the inner walls of the arteries carrying blood to the heart, thereby restricting the heart’s supply of blood (“Chest pain,” 2023). Several genetic and lifestyle factors contribute to the risk of developing angina. For example, there is evidence of a positive relationship between age and developing angina; an increase of plaque build up in the arteries is correlated with an increase in age (“Causes and risk,” 2020).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Is it possible to predict chest pain type (1=typical angina, 2=atypical angina, 3=non-anginal pain or 4=asymptomatic*) for a given heart disease patient based on various revelent medical factors and patient information?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** Cleveland Heart Disease Processed Data set from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease. The sample size (ie. number of rows) of this dataset is 303. The database contains 76 attributes in total, though this specific set uses a subset of 14 of them, which can be viewed below as we read in the data. The data will be further described throughout our preliminary and exploratory data analysis. "

    "### Explanotory Data Analysis\n",

    "First, we will start by reading in the dataset from its URL code. The data is untidy - there are no column names, and some variables that should be categorical are categorized as numerical variables instead. We must tidy the data before continuing further data analysis. Our tidy data has proper readable column names, and the variables are correctly categorized (ie. categorical values are listed numerically), which may be unhelpful when trying to visualize and understand the data in R. It is much easier to do data analysis and build a classification model from tidy data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will rename the columns so that they are named as the correct variable as listed in the Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset description. Then, since we are not using all the variables given in the dataset, we will select specific columns based on our variables of interest to clean and wrangle the data further. For instance, some columns are unspecified or don't have enough information on their meaning from the website (`thal`, `oldpeak`, `slope`, `ca`, and `num`), and when tested further there proved to be no significant relationship that would deem them as possible predictor variables in predicting chest pain type and so we decided not to include them in our data analysis. In addition, `slope` and `ca` contain question marks(?) which designate them as character types rather than integers, and we will therefore exclude them from consideration. Next, we will mutate certain variables (`cp`, `sex`, and `exang`) and change the type of character they were listed as, so that they are categorical and not numerical. "

    "Now, we will split the data into a training and testing set. Our split ratio will be 75:25, meaning that 75% of our data will end up in the training set while the remaining 25% will end up in the testing set. This ensures there is a representative and sizable subset of the data for both capturing the characteristics of the data and evaluating the model's performance. Since splitting the data is a randomized process, we used the function `set.seed` to ensure reproducibility. In testing the performance of the classifier on new unseen data, we can ensure that the model is reliable and accurate in predicting chest pain type and can be generalized to new data."

Similarly, another study by Indrakumari et al., (2020) using exploratory data analyses and the K-means algorithm to predict chest pain type based on several factors came to the same conclusion.

    "**Our Findings:**\n",
    "We wanted to discover if it's possible to predict chest pain type for a given heart disease patient based on various relevant medical factors and patient information. Through our data analysis, we found that `age` and `thalach` (or maximum heart rate) would be the most likely medical factors to help with this prediction. After collecting metrics on our classification model, we found the accuracy to be 0.47. Thus, we can infer that it is possible to predict chest pain type based on maximum heart rate and age which aligns with the research conducted by Li et al., (2021) and Indrakumari et al., (2020), though the accuracy is not significantly high. We can assume this is because there are many factors at play contributing to chest pain type that were not regarded in our analysis, making it difficult to predict with high accuracy what kind a patient may have.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we expected to find:**\n",
    "We wanted to predict the type of chest pain (1=typical angina, 2=atypical angina, 3=non-anginal pain or 4=asymptomatic*) a patient with heart disease/conditions could expect to have based on relevant medical factors and personal information as noted by the variables of interest listed above. Since the graphs in our preliminary analysis did not show a clear distribution of data or a distinct relationship correlated with chest pain type, it was hard to determine what we would expect to find. Thus, we focused on refining our list of chosen predictor variables to determine whether the variables chosen are effective predictors or not. Based on research conducted by Li et al., (2021) in determining which physical parameters were significant in predicting chest pain type, a chi-square analysis revealed that `thalach` (maximum heart rate achieved) and `age` were amongst the most significant factors with thalach exceeding the other factors remarkably. Therefore we expected to find a relatively high accuracy in using `age` and `thalach` as our predictors in our classification analysis. However, it turned out to not be quite accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact of our findings:**\n",
    "Predicting chest pain type and therefore the severity of the chest pain can provide a physician with the necessary information needed to treat a patient's heart disease. Further data analysis could determine if there are any additional significant factor(s), if any, that directly lead to a certain chest pain type in order to help physicians when prescribing medications or choosing a course of action for a patient. Future implications of this study would also allow physicians to implement early intervention techniques in clinical practice by noting of which age subgroup and `thalach` level correspond to the likelihood of developing each chest pain type. In developing such interventions, heart disease may be more easily treatable and possibly even preventable. A similar study was completed on predicting coronary heart disease (CHD) in primary care patients with chest pain, in which they were searching for a CHD score that would help physicians in ruling out CHD in patients experiencing chest pain in order to save time and resources that would be spent on further analyses on patients such like ECG’s, blood tests and other major scans (Gencer et al., 2010). The impact of our exploratory analysis and other similar analyses would greatly help physicians worldwide to build upon the research found and draw more conclusions on finding easier methods of spotting heart disease from chest pain in order to provide the best care for patients.\n",

    "**Future Questions:**\n",
    "- Is this classification model consistent with data in other parts of the world (eg. Hungary, Switzerland, etc)? \n",
    "- What other variables could be used in predicting chest pain that we haven't already accounted for, and if those variables were added, would that increase the estimate accuracy?\n",
    "- Are there any other diseases that share the same significant predictor variables as chest pain? If so, how can we distinguish between these diseases and chest pain?"
